//! # Market Creation Module
//!
//! This module implements the functionality for creating new prediction markets in the
//! Kong Swap platform. It handles validation of market parameters, initialization of
//! market structures, and application of appropriate permissions based on creator status.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Multi-token Support**: Markets can be created with different token types (KONG, ICP, etc.)
//! - **Time-weighted Distribution**: Optional exponential weighting model that rewards earlier bets
//! - **Flexible End Times**: Markets can end after a duration or at a specific date
//! - **Governance Controls**: Admin-created markets are immediately active, while user-created
//!   markets require activation (and later dual approval for resolution)
//!
//! The module maintains a global atomic counter to ensure each market receives a unique ID,
//! even across canister upgrades.

/// Global atomic counter for generating unique market IDs
///
/// This counter is maintained across canister upgrades through the stable memory
/// restoration process. When the canister upgrades, the counter is reset to the
/// highest market ID found in stable storage plus one.
pub static MARKET_ID: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

/// Creates a new prediction market with specified parameters
///
/// This function allows users or admins to create new prediction markets. The markets
/// can use various token types and distribution models (standard or time-weighted).
/// Admin-created markets are immediately active, while user-created markets start in
/// a pending state and require activation before accepting bets.
///
/// ## Market Creation Flows
///
/// The system supports two distinct creation flows based on the creator's role:
///
/// 1. **Admin-Created Markets**:
///    - Start in `Active` status immediately
///    - Can be directly resolved by any admin without dual approval
///    - Useful for official or curated prediction markets
///
/// 2. **User-Created Markets**:
///    - Start in `Pending` status
///    - Require activation with an initial bet by the creator
///    - Need dual approval for resolution (creator and admin must agree)
///    - Support community-driven market creation
///
/// ## Time-Weighted Distribution
///
/// The platform's innovative time-weighted distribution model rewards earlier bets with
/// higher payouts using an exponential decay function. With the default parameter Î± = 0.1,
/// bets placed at market start receive 10x the weight of those placed at market end.
///
/// This creates several advantages:
/// - Incentivizes early price discovery
/// - Rewards users who take positions when uncertainty is highest
/// - Maintains a guaranteed return floor (all winners get at least their original bet back)
///
/// ## Multi-Token Support
///
/// Markets can be denominated in various token types:
/// - KONG tokens (platform native token)
/// - ICP (Internet Computer Protocol tokens)
/// - Other supported ICRC-1/ICRC-2 compliant tokens
///
/// Each token has specific configuration for:
/// - Minimum activation amount
/// - Transfer fees
/// - Platform fee percentages
///
/// # Parameters
/// * `question` - The main question or title of the prediction market
/// * `category` - Market category for organization and filtering
/// * `rules` - Detailed rules and conditions for market resolution
/// * `outcomes` - Possible outcomes users can bet on (2-10 allowed)
/// * `resolution_method` - Method for determining the winning outcome
/// * `end_time_secs` - When the market closes for betting (duration or specific date)
/// * `image_url` - Optional URL to an image representing the market
/// * `uses_time_weighting` - Whether to use time-weighted distribution (default: true)
/// * `time_weight_alpha` - Decay parameter for time-weighting (default: 0.1)
/// * `token_id` - Token type to use for this market (default: KONG)
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<MarketId, String>` - On success, returns the ID of the new market.
///   On failure, returns an error message explaining why creation failed.
///
/// # Creation Process
/// 1. **Validation**:
///    - Question length and content validation
///    - Outcome count validation (2-10 outcomes)
///    - Token support verification
///    - End time validation
///
/// 2. **Initialization**:
///    - Generate unique market ID
///    - Set initial state (pools, percentages, etc.)
///    - Configure time-weighted parameters if enabled
///
/// 3. **Status Assignment**:
///    - Admin creators: Market starts as `Active`
///    - User creators: Market starts as `Pending` (requires activation bet)
