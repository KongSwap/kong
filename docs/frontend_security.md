# King Kong Swap Frontend Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the steps taken to enhance the security of the King Kong Swap frontend application, ensuring it adheres to best practices and mitigates common vulnerabilities. The application is a decentralized application (dApp) hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), with authentication managed by the Plug wallet or Internet Identity.

## Security Enhancements

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

A Content Security Policy has been implemented to control the resources that the browser can load. This helps mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

**CSP Directives:**
- `default-src 'self';` - Allows content to be loaded only from the same origin.
- `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval';` - Allows scripts only from the same origin and temporarily allows `unsafe-eval` to address legacy code dependencies.
- `style-src 'self' https://use.typekit.net https://p.typekit.net;` - Allows styles from the same origin and specified trusted sources.
- `font-src 'self' https://use.typekit.net;` - Allows fonts from the same origin and specified trusted sources.
- `img-src 'self' data:;` - Allows images from the same origin and data URIs.
- `connect-src 'self' http://localhost:4943;` - Allows connections only to the same origin and the specified development API endpoint.
- `frame-src 'self';` - Allows framing content only from the same origin.
- `object-src 'none';` - Disallows the use of `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` tags.
- `base-uri 'self';` - Restricts the URLs that can be loaded using the `<base>` element to the same origin.

### Permissions Policy

A Permissions Policy has been set to restrict the use of certain powerful features.

**Directive:**
- `clipboard-write=(self)` - Allows clipboard write access only from the same origin.

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

The HTTP Strict Transport Security header has been implemented to enforce HTTPS connections, ensuring data is encrypted in transit.

**Directive:**
- `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - Enforces HTTPS for all connections for one year, including subdomains.

### Additional Security Headers

Additional security headers have been added to mitigate common vulnerabilities.

**Directives:**
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents the browser from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type.
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering and prevents the page from loading if an attack is detected.

### DOM Input Sanitization

To prevent XSS attacks, all user inputs are sanitized before being processed or displayed. The DOMPurify library is used to clean any HTML content.

**Example Implementation:**
```jsx
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizeInput = (input) => {
  return DOMPurify.sanitize(input);
};

const handleInputChange = (event) => {
  const sanitizedValue = sanitizeInput(event.target.value);
  setYouPay(sanitizedValue);
};
```

## Current Security Status

### Summary of Implemented Measures

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** 
   - Controls the sources of content that the browser can load.
   - Prevents XSS by disallowing inline scripts and only allowing scripts from trusted sources.
   
2. **Permissions Policy:**
   - Restricts clipboard write access to the same origin.
   
3. **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
   - Enforces HTTPS connections for one year, including subdomains.
   
4. **Additional Security Headers:**
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing.
   - Enables XSS protection and blocks the page if an attack is detected.
   
5. **DOM Input Sanitization:**
   - Sanitizes all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.

### Remaining Considerations

- **Unsafe-Eval:** The temporary inclusion of `unsafe-eval` in the CSP is a potential security risk. Efforts should be made to refactor the codebase to eliminate the need for `eval()` and remove `unsafe-eval` from the CSP.
- **Environment-Specific CSP:** The current CSP allows connections to `http://localhost:4943` for development. Ensure this is removed or adjusted appropriately for production environments.
- **Regular Updates and Audits:** Regularly update dependencies and perform security audits to identify and mitigate new vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The King Kong Swap frontend has been enhanced with robust security measures, including a strict Content Security Policy, Permissions Policy, HSTS, and additional security headers. User inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks. By maintaining these practices and addressing the remaining considerations, the application can provide a secure environment for its users.
